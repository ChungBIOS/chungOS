# Backstory
* I’m a nerd.
* My friends and colleagues think I’m a robot sometimes as I think and work in systems and am overly rational & logical.
* I started writing a lot of stuff down about 3 years ago - apparently this is called journaling
* ChungOS is public released version of my thoughts.
* Everything here is WIP
