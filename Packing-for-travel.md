Packing-for-travel


I live in London but I travel for work quite a lot. Mainly to cities on direct flights - Berlin, San Francisco, New York. I prefer to travel light, hand baggage only. I can travel with just hand luggage for any trip length. 

##Main tips
1. *Packing cubes & pouches* - helps compress clothes into a smaller unit. Pouches for electronics / cables. Reusable ziplock bag for toiletries. I pack a spare packing cube for laundry.
2. *Pre-packed* - my toiletries and cables are in pre-packed pouches. I use refillable dispensers for 
2. *Make a list* - unless you travel frequently enough have pre-packed components.
3. *Avoid bulky things you can easily buy locally* - mainly applies to cheap toiletries, such as toothpaste.
4. *Work and entertainment offline* - download shows for offline viewing on your iPad. Make sure any docs you might need to work on are local or you’ve recently opened your apps as many apps have a local cache. 
5. *Local SIM* - Data can be expensive if you don’t have a good roaming plan. I use EE which gives me data in the US and EU on the same tariff.
6. *Power* - take a spare power bank. Find a good multiple USB charger that can also power your main laptop. I avoid bulky plug converters and use a kettle cable that has the local
7. *Access and comfort* - I use a backpack as I find having both hands free is helpful. I keep things I need to in easy to access pockets. My passport is almost always in my pocket. Toiletries bag on top for security checks. 
8. *Weather and activities* - check the weather
9. *Update your packing list* - you will forget stuff. 
10. *Pack the night before if leaving early* -
